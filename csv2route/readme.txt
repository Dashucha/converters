How to use CSV to UgCS route converter

CSV files should contain 3 columns - Lattitude, Longtitude, Altitude. Any data after third column will be ignored. Please see samples.

Simple drop your CSV file to !csv2route.cmd file and UgCS route will be created in same folder as your CSV file.

Next you can create new route in UgCS, select "Import from file" and enjoy.

This converter will work only on Windows.

Good luck, 
UgCS team
